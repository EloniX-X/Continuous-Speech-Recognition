# Continuous-Speech-Recognition
done with sr it automatically records your voice, I tried to get it as low as i could for a project which will be releasing shortly after the hobeline 1.2 release.
right now its like 5 second chunks but thats better than nothing, i made it so i could record the teacher and if she calls on me i already know the answer cus im just  that insanely good and smart and cool ig
